# 📱 Personal Finance Manager

**Personal Finance Manager** is a lightweight, offline Android application built using **Kotlin**, **XML**, and **Room Database (SQLite)**. This app is designed to help users easily track their day-to-day income and expenses without needing internet access.

This project was completely developed by me as part of my academic journey, and it's a demonstration of clean code, Android architecture, and user-focused design.
