# 📱 Personal Finance Manager

**Personal Finance Manager** is a fully offline Android application developed using **Kotlin**, **XML**, and **Room Database (SQLite)**. It is designed to help users track their day-to-day financial activities including income and expenses, without requiring internet access.

This app was completely developed by me as part of my academic in-house project at Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad.
